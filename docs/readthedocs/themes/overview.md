# Theme system

Theme system is a way to customize the look and feel of your CV.

The theme must be located in the `themes` directory in the current working directory.

```tree
themes
└── <my-theme-name>
    ├── theme.yaml     # Theme metadata (required)
    └── index.html     # Theme template (required)
``` 

Themes offer these abilities:

* Easily switch between themes
* Write your own theme
* Publish yours to share them with the community
* Download themes from the community
